# Decisions

<!-- Agent: significant decisions made and reasoning -->

## 2026-05-28 — Foundation MVP scope

**Decision:** Ship landing page + plant profile template (safe/toxic) + 3 seed pages. Defer list pages and search tool.

**Reasoning:** Per prime directive progression — individual plant pages are the atomic unit. Search tool needs ~50 plants to be useful.

## 2026-05-28 — MDX + zod content model

**Decision:** One MDX file per plant with typed frontmatter validated by zod at build time.

**Reasoning:** Balances editorial prose flexibility with schema enforcement. Build fails on missing ASPCA citation or invalid SEO fields.

## 2026-05-28 — Static export

**Decision:** Next.js static export (`output: "export"`) hosted on Vercel.

**Reasoning:** Per prime directive. Maximum performance, minimal hosting cost, ideal for SEO content site.
